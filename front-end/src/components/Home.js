       Abstract
      </h3>
      <p>The goal of our study was to determine whether a correlation exists between wealth and happiness in Australia. Due to a lack of surveys measuring self-reported citizen happiness, we chose to use an approach of Tweet text sentiment analysis to determine the happiness levels across Australia. Overall, our study found no correlation between these two variables.

      <h3>
      Study assumptions
      </h3>
      <p>
      When analysing data we assume the following statements to hold true.
      <ul>
      <li>
      Tweet sentiment score is strongly correlated with happiness levels among the tweeting population.
      </li>
      <li>The sentiment analysis method we chose (AFINN) is sufficient to accurately determine Tweet sentiment.</li>
      <li>The metrics we used to determine wealth levels are representative.</li>
      <li>The wealth metrics we used have not drastically changed since 2016.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
      Measures used in the study
      </h3>
      <p>We used a wide range of metrics to establish wealth levels across Australia:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Equivalised total weekly household income</li>
      <li>Annual median personal income</li>
      <li>Average monthly rent</li>
      <li>Average monthly mortgage payments</li>
      <li>Unemployment rate</li>
      <li>Median house price</li>
      </ul>
